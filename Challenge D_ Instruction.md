# Case Scenario
A staff member has requested a list of the names of the services recognized by the current Linux image. A file named /etc/services has been located that contains the pertinent information; however it is not organized to easily determine all of the services.

Using a combination of pipes, redirects and control statements, produce output that contains only the service names. The entire task must be accomplished without using any intermediary files. Each service should only be listed once and captured to a file named uniqueservices.txt, located in the home directory. Remove any blank lines or lines that are deemed to be comments.

There could be more than one possible solution for obtaining the desired results.
